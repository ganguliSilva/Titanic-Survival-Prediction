# Titanic-Survival-Prediction
Machine Learning project predicting survival on the Titanic using decision trees. Includes EDA, preprocessing, and model evaluation. (scikit-learn, pandas, decision trees).

📌 Project Objectives:-
    * Perform data cleaning and preprocessing on the Titanic dataset.
    * Explore the dataset visually and statistically.
    * Build a Decision Tree Classifier to predict survival.
    * Evaluate the model using metrics like accuracy and the confusion matrix.
    * Visualize the decision-making process using a decision tree plot.
    * Understand feature importance and correlations.
